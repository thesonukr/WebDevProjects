    <h1>Secrets Of Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <ol>    
    <li>It’s believed that in Ancient Egypt (or event Mesopotamia) games that involved three-in-a-row were played.</li>
    <li>Many resources will tell you that Tic-Tac-Toe originated from a game played in Ancient Roman. The game is said to have been played in Rome in the 1st Century BC. </li>
    <li>In the 1st Century, the game was actually played with pebbles and the name “Terni Lapilli” translates to “Three Pebbles at a Time.”</li>
    <li>Before the game was truly understood for what it is (just a game), some people believed that it was a type of pagan ritual and that the grid actually possessed magical elements.</li>
    <li>OXO” was the first Tic-Tac-Toe game created as an EDSAC computer program in 1952. As such, the very first video game the world ever saw was Tic-Tac-Toe.</li>
    <li>There were secret societies at the time that believed the grid could uncover secrets of the world, and so it was often called “The Nine Chambers of the Kabbalah” by those who believed it.</li>
